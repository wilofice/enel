# Web Profile Management

The dashboard includes a simple page to view and edit contact profiles.
Open `/profiles.html` and select a contact from the list.
Their current profile text will load in a text area and can be updated.

Profiles are stored in the `Contacts` table and can also be generated automatically with `node src/profileJob.js`.
